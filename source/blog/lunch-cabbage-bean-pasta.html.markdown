Ingredients (for 2-3 large meals):

__pasta__ (any kind is good, get the cheapest kind that doesn't contain animal ingredients)  
__half a head of cabbage__ (medium size cabbage)  
__2 medium size carrots__  
__1 can of beans__  
__2 tablespoons of tomato paste__  
__spices__ (I used salt, pepper, red paprika, curry, garlic powder)  
few fresh leaves of parsley (optional)  

Cut cabbage into strips, wash it and put it in a big enough pot or wok (it really doesn't have to be a wok, the simplest pot will do :)). Peel and grate the carrots if you don't have a food processor (I don't ;)).

Add half glass of water and stew the cabbage (stir and add water if needed until it becomes tender). If you add salt it will speed up the process because salt drains water from the cabbage. Now add the carrots and keep cooking. Be sure to stir every few minutes so it doesn't burn. Add some garlic powder - around half of teaspoon. You don't have to add it but it really gives it a great taste.

Now you can add beans - rinse them if you like it to be a bit thicker or add the whole can if you want it to be thin (I rinsed mine), add tomato paste and spices. Don't forget to add water anytime it gets too dry so it wouldn't start burning. At the end, add chopped parsley. When it all blends nicely together it is done!

The whole process shouldn't take more than 30 minutes. You can cook the pasta before or after, just see instructions on the package. When pasta is cooked just mix it with the stew and enjoy!

I didn't specify the exact measurements because it doesn't really matter, you can play around with it or just use as much as you have at home. The point of super basic vegan meals is that you don't overthink it and just __use what is most convenient but still healthy__.


**As you can see there is __no oil__ in this recipe but you will find that it's still very tasty and juicy. Eating beans without any oil will help you __digest it better and be less gassy__. I couldn't even eat beans before because I would get severe stomach pain from it but now it's just yummy and great! :)*
