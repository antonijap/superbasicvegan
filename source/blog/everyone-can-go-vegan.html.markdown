I started this blog inspired by many vegans in social media. Still, it took quite a while for me to take this step. Coming from a standard first world diet - rich in dairy, meat, fat and processed sugars, I was always taught that meet is good for me, dairy helps my bones and digestion and "quality oils" are the absolute medicine for my body! It is really hard to change the whole mindset towards food even though you've realised it's wrong. But even once you do it and consider changing your diet completely there are a lot of imaginary obstacles that you face and that can turn you away:

"Healthy food is expensive!"

"Healthy food takes long time to cook and prepare!"

"There are limited shops where I can buy my food!"

"I absolutely need an expensive blender!"

"Where am I going to find tropical fruit and vegetables?!"

"When will I have time to eat all this food so I wouldn't be hungry all day long?!"...

Soon I discovered that every one of this "problems" can be easily solved, and that you can go vegan no matter where you live and how much time and money you have - three things that many people have little to no control of.

Most important information is that there are many ways to be vegan and you can choose what suits you best. Surprisingly, the cheapest way is also the easiest and among the healthiest! Yay!
