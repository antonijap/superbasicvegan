If you are tired of oats and just want to “cheat” with something super yummy sometimes, it doesn’t have to be super unhealthy or non vegan!

Vegan crepes are easy to make and require really __basic skills and ingredients__: flour, water, salt and some baking powder. What you put on them is totally up to you, but even good old bananas will do. I used a bit of jam just because i don’t like the combination of moist fresh fruit and crepes (when crepes get “wet” :P). You can use any fresh, frozen or canned fruit, jam, peanut butter or just sugar. I made this the “healthiest” I could while cheap and tasty as non-vegan, high-fat crepes.

Here’s how you do it:

Mix __water__, __flour__, a pinch of __salt__ (add more salt if you want a stronger taste) and half of teaspoon of __baking powder__ in a bowl until it’s thick as regular pancake batter (better thicker than runny). Put one teaspoon of oil on any sort of non-stick pan (teflon etc.) and spread it around with a bit of paper towel (wipe off any excess). Heat the pan on low heat.

Pour the batter and spread it until it’s thin enough and fry it until it hardens (since there is no oil and only low heat it will not change color significantly but it also won’t stick to the pan ;)). Flip it and fry a bit more and it’s done!
Now spread a teaspoon of __jam or jelly__ on one crepe (really, you won’t need more than that!) and add __banana slices__ - for sweetness, and pieces of __cherry compote__ (or fresh/frozen berries, canned fruit etc.) - for flavor.

Make yourself a cup of tea or coffee and have a great, yummy start of your day! :)
